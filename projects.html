                In my free time I enjoy creating posters with the goal of experimenting and developing my creativity. Since I know how to use Adobe Photoshop, I have been able to explore around with different designs and ideas.

                One of the ways I show appreciation to someone is by making graphic design posts for them. For example, my cousin is a fan of the Boston Celtics, and because they had a baby recently, I though it would be a cute touch to combine both of his loves in one place.
