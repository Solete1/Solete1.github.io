                Hello, I was born in the United States, but grew up in Spain. I spent eleven years in Mallorca, a beautiful island that has been growing in popularity. Overall, I enjoy learning, going on adventures, and meeting new people. My MBTI is ENFP, I am an Aries, and I am twenty-one-years-old.

                I transferred to Babson College in the Fall of 2024. So far, I have really liked my time in Boston and am taking advantage of every opportunity I can. My future plans include living in a sunny place, exploring the world, and working in fields I enjoy. Additionally, I would love to help animals in any capacity that I am able to.

                One of my hobbies includes traveling around the world. I still have many places to visit, but little by little I hope to place foot in all 195 of countries! My next must-visits are <i>Australia, Bolivia, New Zealand, Nepal, and China</i>. Fingers crossed I get to visit one day.

                In the meantime, I entertain myself with learning and memorising the flags of the world. Click 
                <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/worldflags" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>
                to learn about them and practice your knowledge. Personally, my next challenge is to learn every African flag!
